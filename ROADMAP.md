# Agent Smith — Roadmap

## Planned

### Save API keys to Keychain
API keys (e.g. Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible provider keys) are currently stored in plain text (UserDefaults or configuration files). Move all API key storage to the macOS Keychain using the Security framework (`SecItemAdd`/`SecItemCopyMatching`). This improves security by keeping secrets out of plist files and app defaults exports.

### Task-scoped context and state for resumability
All context and state related to a given task needs to be tied to the task itself. Currently, when a task is interrupted (e.g. the app is stopped mid-task), the task status resets to pending but all associated context — Brown's conversation history, partial work, tool call results — is lost. When the task is later resumed, agents must start from scratch with no memory of prior progress.

**Goal:** An incomplete task should carry enough state that it can be resumed where it left off rather than restarting. This includes Brown's conversation history for the task, any intermediate results or artifacts, and the point at which work was interrupted.

### Smith fails to read task details when resuming interrupted tasks ✅
When the system restarts with tasks that were in-progress (now reset to pending), Smith notifies the user and asks how to proceed. When told to run the task, Smith asks clarifying questions that are already answered in the task's title and description — e.g. asking "what text should I append?" when the task description says `Append the text "monkies rock" to the end of the file`. Smith should use the `get_tasks` tool (or equivalent) to read the full task details before attempting to execute, rather than relying only on the summary from the startup notification.

**Implemented:** Added a prominent guideline in Smith's system prompt (SmithBehavior.swift) instructing Smith to always call `list_tasks` before acting on any task. The existing belt-and-suspenders instruction in OrchestrationRuntime.swift's initial message was retained.

### Preserve agent inspector data after termination
When an agent is terminated, its conversation history and LLM turn records are lost because the `AgentActor` is deallocated. Users should be able to review what happened in a terminated agent's session — especially useful for debugging why Brown failed or what Jones flagged.

**Approach:** Before removing an agent from the `agents` dictionary in `terminateAgent` and `handleAgentSelfTerminate`, snapshot the agent's `contextSnapshot()` and `turnsSnapshot()` into a separate archive keyed by agent ID. Expose this archive via `OrchestrationRuntime` so the UI inspector can display historical sessions alongside live ones.

### Power assertion to continue running with lid closed ✅
Use `IOPMAssertion` (or `ProcessInfo.processInfo.beginActivity`) to prevent the system from sleeping while agents are actively working. The behavior should be power-source-aware:

- **On battery**: Assert for up to **15 minutes** after the user closes the lid or goes idle, then release the assertion and allow sleep.
- **On AC power**: Assert for up to **1 hour** after lid close / idle, then release.

The assertion should only be held while there are active tasks or running agents. When all tasks complete or are cancelled, release the assertion immediately. Monitor power source changes via `IOPSNotificationCreateRunLoopSource` to adjust the timeout dynamically if the user plugs in or unplugs mid-task.

**Implemented:** Created `PowerAssertionManager` actor using `IOPMAssertionCreateWithName` with `kIOPMAssertionTypePreventSystemSleep`. Uses a single 15-minute inactivity timeout (no power source differentiation — simplified from original plan). Assertion is acquired on `start()`, reset on every LLM call or user message, and released when both the 15-minute timer fires AND no active tasks exist. Released immediately on `stopAll()`. Wired into `OrchestrationRuntime` via `sendUserMessage` and `notifyProcessingStateChange`.

### Add `bash` tool for better environment availability
The current `shell` tool may not provide full PATH and environment variable availability. Add a `bash` tool that executes commands via `/bin/bash -c <arguments>`, which sources the user's shell profile and provides access to the full PATH and environment values that the user would have in an interactive terminal session. This improves reliability for commands that depend on tools installed via Homebrew, nvm, pyenv, etc.
