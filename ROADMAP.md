# Agent Smith — Roadmap

## Planned

### Preserve agent inspector data after termination
When an agent is terminated, its conversation history and LLM turn records are lost because the `AgentActor` is deallocated. Users should be able to review what happened in a terminated agent's session — especially useful for debugging why Brown failed or what Jones flagged.

**Approach:** Before removing an agent from the `agents` dictionary in `terminateAgent` and `handleAgentSelfTerminate`, snapshot the agent's `contextSnapshot()` and `turnsSnapshot()` into a separate archive keyed by agent ID. Expose this archive via `OrchestrationRuntime` so the UI inspector can display historical sessions alongside live ones.
