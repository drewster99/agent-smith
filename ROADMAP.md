# Agent Smith — Roadmap

## Planned

### Task-scoped context and state for resumability
All context and state related to a given task needs to be tied to the task itself. Currently, when a task is interrupted (e.g. the app is stopped mid-task), the task status resets to pending but all associated context — Brown's conversation history, partial work, tool call results — is lost. When the task is later resumed, agents must start from scratch with no memory of prior progress.

**Goal:** An incomplete task should carry enough state that it can be resumed where it left off rather than restarting. This includes Brown's conversation history for the task, any intermediate results or artifacts, and the point at which work was interrupted.

### Smith fails to read task details when resuming interrupted tasks
When the system restarts with tasks that were in-progress (now reset to pending), Smith notifies the user and asks how to proceed. When told to run the task, Smith asks clarifying questions that are already answered in the task's title and description — e.g. asking "what text should I append?" when the task description says `Append the text "monkies rock" to the end of the file`. Smith should use the `get_tasks` tool (or equivalent) to read the full task details before attempting to execute, rather than relying only on the summary from the startup notification.

### Preserve agent inspector data after termination
When an agent is terminated, its conversation history and LLM turn records are lost because the `AgentActor` is deallocated. Users should be able to review what happened in a terminated agent's session — especially useful for debugging why Brown failed or what Jones flagged.

**Approach:** Before removing an agent from the `agents` dictionary in `terminateAgent` and `handleAgentSelfTerminate`, snapshot the agent's `contextSnapshot()` and `turnsSnapshot()` into a separate archive keyed by agent ID. Expose this archive via `OrchestrationRuntime` so the UI inspector can display historical sessions alongside live ones.
